Place these files in the appropriate directory for use:

On Linux: /home/<username>/.nbems/custom

On Android: /storage/emulated/0/NBEMS.files/EntryForms
and /storage/emulated/0/NBEMS.files/DisplayForms

On Flmsg, once the forms are imported into your flmsg ‘Custom’ form folder, then
open up your flmsg program. Click on the ‘Form’ tab and place your curser
over the ‘Custom’ tab in the dropdown menu. A menu should appear
displaying these custom forms available for you to use.

On AndFlmsg, after you import the forms, open the settings and click on "Update Forms".
Slide the screen over several times to the Inbox. Press the Compose button, then
long select one of the HTML forms to open to fill out.
